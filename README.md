# EDA-Udemy-Course-Analysis

## Overview
This project involves performing an exploratory data analysis (EDA) on a dataset containing Udemy courses. The goal is to uncover insights about the factors affecting course popularity, pricing strategies, and subscriber behavior through data visualization and analysis.

## Key Features
- Data Cleaning and Preprocessing: Prepared the dataset by handling missing values and formatting issues for accurate analysis.
- Trend Analysis: Analyzed key trends such as course prices, content duration, and subscriber count to discover what influences course popularity.
- Visualizations: Created insightful visualizations, including scatter plots, histograms, and heatmaps, to identify correlations and patterns.

## Tools Used
- Python: For data manipulation and analysis.
- pandas: To clean, preprocess, and structure the dataset.
- seaborn & matplotlib: For generating visualizations to uncover trends and correlations.
- Jupyter Notebook: For writing, testing, and running code interactively.
